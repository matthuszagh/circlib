* About
libcircuit is a library of electronic, PCB-based (sub)circuits written
in SKiDL. They are meant to be easy to include within larger PCB
designs. Additionally, each circuit is accompanied by SPICE/Xyce
simulations and prototype PCB implementations. A writeup is provided
alongside each PCB implementation describing relevant quality factors
(e.g. noise, clock jitter, etc.). A PCB implementation may have
several variants for different PCB materials. When dealing with
sufficiently high frequencies, OpenEMS simulations are provided to
justify the various layout decisions (e.g. trace width, etc.).
